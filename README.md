# MNIST-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This project is developed to train and test a neural network on TensorFlow for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The neural network consists of 3 Dense layers: two hidden layers, each with 128 neurons, and an output layer. The activation functions on the hidden layers are relu, and softmax on the output layer.
